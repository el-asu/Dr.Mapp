# Dr. Mapp
Access app via: https://drmapp.streamlit.app/ 

The aim of this project was to create a Streamlit application that allows users to identify the nearest healthcare facilities (in Argentina) on a map based on their location.

This project was developed as part of my “Diploma in Data Science, Machine Learning, and its Applications” at the University of Córdoba (FaMAF - UNC, Argentina) in collaboration with my colleagues José Ovejero, Pablo Iribarren, Juliana Márquez y Luciano Theisen.
